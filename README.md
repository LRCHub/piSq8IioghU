# ITZY – TUNNEL VISION

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Eyes on the quest, I don't take vacation
잠 못 들어도 'cause I got that patience
한계점은, nah, 끓어올라 ambition
I'll show my reign
집중 standing ovation
Small talk은 pass, I worked hard for this
Got my poker face, 날 예측 못해
알아 what's my game
목표는 never miss
Work, work, work
시선은 focused, grindin' 'til I score
가치를 높여
Worth, worth, worth
Keep my altitude, 지켜 나를 더
Now I better pause
모두 집중 on alert
Never backing down
내가 찾은 what I want
Nothing's gonna put me off
빛이 날 비춰
I know what the hell I want
Don't need permission
어둠 속 나를 넘어
My motivation
Focus on my level up
I got tunnel vision
Yah, ah-yah, yah-ah-yah-ah
I got tunnel vision
Expanded version 2.0
한계를 태우고 만든 paceset
Hop in my lane
Fast, fast so long
Work, work, work
시선은 focused, grindin' 'til I score
가치를 높여
Worth, worth, worth
Keep my altitude, 지켜 나를 더
Now I better pause
모두 집중 on alert
Never backing down
빛을 쫓아 what I want
Nothing's gonna put me off
빛이 날 비춰
I know what the hell I want
Don't need permission
어둠 속 나를 넘어
My motivation
Focus on my level up
I got tunnel vision
Never lose my sight
전부 걸어
Keep it up, I'm a stunner
시작해 making the buzz (What?)
내 vision은 언제나 plus
Celebrate I toast
피어난 꿈은 rose
Stack it up, stack it up on my own
I don't flex
All the risk, 이겨내, here I go
Focus
Nothing's gonna put me off
빛이 날 비춰
I know what the hell I want
Don't need permission
어둠 속 나를 넘어
My motivation
Focus on my level up
I got tunnel vision
Yah, ah-yah, yah-ah-yah-ah
I got tunnel vision
Yah, ah-yah, yah-ah-yah-ah
I got tunnel vision
I got tunnel vision
