[00:01.62] You were clean
[00:04.14] You were calm
[00:06.81] Standing in the doorway
[00:10.65] Singing afterthoughts
[00:16.68] You count your blessings in the dark
[00:20.90] Expelling words above you
[00:25.09] To keep when we wake up
[00:36.59] 
[00:30.99] I press the hand upon my chest
[00:36.15] Distorting into one
[00:39.75] Returning back to Earth
[00:51.25] 
[00:46.30] A love enormous and enough
[00:50.24] Pacing to ignore
[00:53.71] How it begins and how it ends
